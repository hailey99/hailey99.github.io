##I FINALLY started Github pages!

Today is May 1st 2019, the day I'm flying out to Seoul. It's been a year since I left there on April 27th, 2018!
One of my goal this May is creating my own Github page and post at least 2 blogs.
So, I'm posting this blog at Toronto Pearson Airport that always brings up the memory of the first day in Canada.

I just wanna share some songs that I can't love more and the feelings I go through whenever I listen to the songs.

One is _Lee Sora - Track 9_. This comforting song is what I listened to at the plane to Toronto. I embedded the youtube video playing with a river view of Seoul I can't wait to see it.

The other one is the song I'm gonna listen to in the air heading to Seoul. I've known this band only for 3 weeks but I'm sure I'll stan it for a long time cuz this band let me know the coolness of Thai indie band. It's a shame I can't understand Thai tho.

Anyway, I hope you all like my new Github page and this bops. See you in Korea!
