Are you a type of person who believes in the constellation test? <br><br>

Are you a type of person who tries all kinds of personality test like MBTI even though you know what you are?<br><br>

Are you a type of person who asks others the first impression of you?<br><br>

Congratulations!<br><br>

If you are those type of person, <br><br>

you are on the right track.<br><br><br>

​

Just like you, I, iterally, love analyzing the characteristics of my favorite movies' heroes, or celebrities. However, the funniest personal trait to analyze would be mine.
<br><br><br>
​

Let's keep behind the fact that I once, like 3 seconds, planned having a star debut just to be analyzed by my imaginary fans.

​<br><br><br><br>

​

SO,

​<br><br><br>

I'm gonna analyze my book wish list that I've bookmarked for a year <br><br>

using R <br><br>

to be specific,<br><br>

scientific,<br><br>

and terrific.<br><br>

(This is my first time to make English rhyme.)<br><br><br>

​

I'm sure this analytics will help me know myself who is, at the same time, independent and made of my life experiences<br><br><br>

​

because<br><br><br>



As a human, we are continuously influenced by the beloved books, films, and musics and they make ourselves even though we seem an abstract and independent creatures.  <br><br>


The things I want to analyze and share with you are<br><br>

​

1. What is the word that appears most often in the titles of books on my book wish list?
<br>
2. What publishers are my favorite?
<br>
3. What book series I love the most?
<br>
4. What kind of book I am interested in the most?
<br><br><br><br>
​

​

​

I hope I can pioneer one kind of art that only I can do, based on what I found aside from the truth.

​
<br><br>
​

Would you dive into my book wish list?

​<br><br>

​

You are always welcome!<br>
