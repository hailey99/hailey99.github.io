Are you a type of person who believes in the constellation test? <br><br>


Are you a type of person who tries all kinds of personality test like MBTI even though you know what you are?<br><br>


Are you a type of person who asks others the first impression of you?<br><br>

Congratulations!<br><br>

If you are those type of person, <br><br>

you are on the right track.<br><br><br>

​

Just like you, I literally love analyzing the characteristics of my favorite movies' heroes, or celebrities. However, the funniest trait to scrutinize would be mine.
<br><br><br>
​

Let's keep behind the fact that I once, like 3 seconds, planned having a star debut just to be analyzed by my imaginary fans.

​<br><br><br><br>

​

SO,

​<br><br><br>

I'm gonna analyze my book wishlist that I've bookmarked and saved for a year <br><br>

using R <br><br>

to be specific,<br><br>

scientific,<br><br>

and terrific.<br><br>

(This is my first time making English rhyme.)<br><br><br>

​

I'm sure this analytics will help me know myself who is, at the same time, independent and made of my life experiences<br><br><br>

​

because<br><br><br>



As human, we are continuously influenced by beloved books, films, and music. And it's uncontentious that they make ourselves even though we seem abstract and independent creatures.  <br><br>


The things I want to analyze and share with you are are<br><br>

​

1. What is <b>the word that appears most often in the titles</b> of books on my book wishlist?
<br>
2. What <b>publishing corporation</b> is my favorite?
<br>
3. What <b>book series</b> do I love the most?
<br>
4. What <b>genre of book</b> I am interested in the most?
<br><br><br><br>
​

​
​
<br><br>
​

Shall we dive into my book wishlist?

​<br><br>

​

You are always welcome!<br>
