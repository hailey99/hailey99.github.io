description: Vending Machine Algorithm using C Language
---

I decided to write a code of a vending machine to practice Algorithm and not to forget C.

It has 7 options.
1. Red Curry - $20
2. Donburi - $15
3. Kimchi Jeon - $8
4. Burrito Bowl - $12
5. Chimichanga - $20
6. Bagel and Cream Cheese - $8
7. Bun Cha - $20

Algorithm
1. Insert money.
2. Choose a menu.
3. You have change. Do you wanna get more food or just change?
    1. choose a menu - Go to 2.
    2. execute change - Go to 4.
4. Close the deal.
